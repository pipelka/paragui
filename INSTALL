Requirements for building the sources:

SDL >= 1.2.0
http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.html

freetype >= 2.0
http://www.freetype.org/download.html

SDL_image >= 1.2.0 (if enabled)
http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image

zlib
http://www.gzip.org/zlib

expat
http://expat.sourceforge.net

Depending on the image fileformats you
want to use you may also find handy:

libpng:
http://www.libpng.org/pub/png

libjpeg:
http://www.ijg.org


You will also need the correponding development packages
(if you are using rpm packages).



Installation for distributions:

./configure [options]
make
make install (as root)

Installation for CVS:

sh autogen.sh
./configure [options]
make
make install (as root)


Useful configure options:

--disable-sdlimage :
Compile the sources without SDL_image support.
Will produce smaller code but only bmp's can be loaded.

--enable-debug :
Will produce debug messages during execution (slow).

--with-themedir=DIR :
ParaGUI themefiles will be placed in DIR.
Default location is PREFIX/share/paragui

--enable-internalexpat:
Use the built-in expat sources (if you don't have libexpat
installed and you don't want to install it).

--enable-internalphysfs:
Use the built-in PhysicsFS library.


Hint:
Several people had troubles compiling CVS snapshots on
SuSE and Slackware.
If you get error messages running the autogen.sh script
please try the following:

Change this line in autogen.sh
aclocal
to:
aclocal -I/usr/local/share/aclocal
